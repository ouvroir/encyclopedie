# LEAF writer
The new text encoding web tool for textual editors
Diane Jakacki


fork: https://github.com/LEAF-VRE/training (public repo)
then login with github at: https://leaf-writer.leaf-vre.org/

choice in who / which authority to use
- document choices 
possibility to create notes and scholarly annotations

→ have rules / restrict uses for collaboration (multiple students working)

export/import from transcribus for encoding.
XSLT is being written to replace what you get from transcribus with a TEI wrapper

API for importing and exporting 

LEAF is a larger environment, of which leaf-writer is only a part.
- most of LEAF are images, AV objects: more multimedia support
- premiere at the [CSDH conference](https://csdh-schn.org/conference2023/) in June

Is there a sort of equivalent of leaf-writer for artworks? 
- LEAF has a function planned to use IIIF annotations 

catalog of 18th century images that are found in books

LEAF is a drupal islandora platform

use for non-latin language? 
- right to left requested by the community and has some support now

thinking about ways to link _Stylo_ and LEAF-writer? 

collaboration / multiple people in the same repo / file
- work on forks and then do pull requests
- assign tasks to avoid people doing the same thing
- LEAF platform will have a workflow stamp (block a document while a task is being executed, then move it on to someone for proofreading)
